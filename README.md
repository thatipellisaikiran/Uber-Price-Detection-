**Uber Price Prediction**
=================================
This project predicts the price of an Uber ride based on various parameters like pickup location, dropoff location, distance, and time. 
The model is implemented using Python and deployed with Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

**Project Overview**
==========================
The goal of this project is to provide users with a real-time prediction of Uber ride prices. Users can input their ride details, and the model will return an estimated fare based on the features provided. 
The model leverages machine learning techniques to predict the price based on historical ride data.

Tech Stack
--------------------
Python: Core programming language used.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: To handle numerical data and calculations.

Scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model.

Streamlit: Web application framework used to create an interactive interface.

Jupyter Notebook: Used for initial data exploration and model building.


**Dataset**
======================
The dataset used in this project contains Uber ride data including pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and fare amounts. 
It was preprocessed to remove outliers and handle missing data.

**Features**
=======================
User Input: Enter ride details (pickup location, drop-off location, distance, etc.)

Prediction: Provides real-time fare estimates based on inputs

Interactive Web App: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction

**How to Run the App**
=============================
Run the command streamlit run app.py in your terminal.
--------------------------------------------------------------
A local URL will appear (e.g., http://localhost:8501), which will open the app in your browser.

Input your ride details:
-----------------------------
Pickup location

Dropoff location

Ride time

Distance (optional)

The app will return the estimated fare.

Features
---------------
Predicts the price of an Uber ride based on user inputs.

Interactive UI built with Streamlit to make predictions easily accessible.

Model fine-tuned on real-world data.

**Model Explanation**
================================
The any machine learning models (or whichever model you used) to predict Uber ride prices. The input features are:

Pickup and dropoff coordinates

Distance between pickup and dropoff

Time of the ride (peak vs non-peak hours)

These factors are used to predict the fare with a high level of accuracy.

**Streamlit Interface**
==============================
The app is designed to be user-friendly:
---------------------------------------------
Input Form: Users can input locations, time, and distance.

Prediction Button: Once details are provided, the app generates the estimated fare.

Real-time Feedback: The result is displayed immediately on the screen.

**Conclusion**
=========================
This Uber Price Prediction app offers an efficient and user-friendly way to estimate ride fares based on various input parameters. 
It showcases the power of machine learning combined with an intuitive web interface, making it a practical tool for real-time price predictions. 
Feel free to explore and enhance the model as needed.
